		<h2>9/11 Memorial & Museum</h2>
		
		<img src="../images/911 Meseum/1.jpg" alt="911 Meseum photo" style="width: 80%;">

		<p>The huge square pool (the ruins of the World Trade Center after the bombing of the World Trade Center), the sound of running water roared loudly, and recorded the names of the victims of the terrorist attack.
			<br>On their birthdays, the museum will put a rose to express their remembrance, and sometimes relatives and friends will put different flowers to cherish them, full of infinite sadness.</p>
		<img src="../images/911 Meseum/3.jpg" alt="Little Island photo" style="float: right;">
		<br><p>On September 11, 2001, the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center, on the same day, two planes held by terrorists successively crashed into the "North Tower" and "South Tower".
			<br>About two hours later, the building melted into rubble, and then a third plane crashed into the Pentagon (the seat of the U.S. Department of Defense, next to Washington, D.C.).
			<br>On the day of 9/11, Ben had a fourth flight that would crash into the White House or the Capitol, but it was admirable to crash at other places under the strong resistance of the crew.</p>
			<img src="../images/911 Meseum/4.jpg" alt="911 Meseum photo" style="width: 80%;">
			<br><br><p>This underground diaphragm wall was built in the 1960s and was considered a major engineering marvel in the design of the original World Trade Center. It was severely damaged after 9/11.</p>
			<img src="../images/911 Meseum/5.jpg" alt="911 Meseum photo" style="width: 80%;">
		<p>What should not be ignored is this "last pillar", which is engraved with names, pictures and messages up and down. It is a steel pillar with work records and the names of the victims at that time.
			This column was cut as a whole in May 2002. It is the last steel column removed from the Ground Zero site, and it is very symbolic.</p>
			<img src="../images/911 Meseum/6.jpg" alt="911 Meseum photo" style="width: 80%;">
			<p>Originally located in the North Tower of the World Trade Center, it is a staircase leading from a high open plaza to the street below it.
				<br>On the day of 9/11, the steps became a passageway for thousands of survivors who escaped from the chaos and explosions. It is not difficult to imagine the helplessness and panic at that time.</p>
